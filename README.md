Cisco Network Configuration Files
This repository contains configuration files for various Cisco network devices, including Access Switches (ASW), Core Switches (CSW), and Distribution Switches (DSW). These configurations demonstrate common network setups, security features, and routing protocols.

Devices Included:
Access Switches (ASW): ASW-A1.txt, ASW-A2.txt, ASW-A3.txt, ASW-B1.txt, ASW-B2.txt, ASW-B3.txt
Core Switches (CSW): CSW1.txt, CSW2.txt
Distribution Switches (DSW): DSW-A1.txt, DSW-A2.txt

Key Features Demonstrated:
VLANs and Trunking: Configuration of VLANs, access ports, and trunk ports (including native VLAN and allowed VLANs).
Spanning Tree Protocol (STP): Rapid-PVST and PVST mode configurations, including priority settings.
DHCP Snooping & ARP Inspection: Security features to prevent unauthorized DHCP servers and ARP spoofing.
Port Security: MAC address sticky and violation restrict modes for access ports.
OSPF Routing: OSPF area 0 configurations for core and distribution layers.
HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol): Redundancy configurations for VLAN interfaces on DSWs.
SSH & Console Access: Secure management access.
NTP: Network Time Protocol synchronization.
SNMP: Simple Network Management Protocol configuration.

Future Enhancements:
Adding detailed topology diagrams.
Including verification commands for each feature.
Providing troubleshooting tips and common issues.
Expanding to include configurations for other network devices (e.g., routers, firewalls).
